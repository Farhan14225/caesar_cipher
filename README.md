# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Encrypt & Decrypt Text

A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher. Encrypt or decrypt messages using a simple letter-shift algorithm.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt (`encode`) and Decrypt (`decode`) messages
- Handles special characters and spaces
- Modular code with `alphabet` and `logo` in a separate file

## 🧠 How It Works
Each letter in the message is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet by a number you choose.

Example:

Original: hello
Shift: 3
Encrypted: khoor
